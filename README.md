# smash-ranking

This repository is focused on building a solution for the Smash Ultimate community.  Using the respective APIs for Smash.gg and Challonge, the goal is to build a player ranking system that ranks all Smash Ultimate players.  

With a refined ranking system, seeding can easily be produced given a tournaments attendees.  

The purpose is to automate this process starting from a small proof-of-concept and iterating to increase functionality and the ranking algortithm criteria itself.
